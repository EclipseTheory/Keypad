Keypad
A functional keypad for the Source engine

Inspirated on SysOp's keypad code for GoldSrc ( http://am.half-lifecreations.com/forums/index.php?topic=531.0 ), 
I made my own for the Source engine.

Features:
-Close and clear buttons.
-Hover and click effects on the buttons.
-Customizable keypad text.
-Typed code can be set to be hidden.
-Has outputs for correct and incorrect codes.

Make sure you read the "TutorialOnHowToInstallOnYourMod" text file for know how to install first.

Coded on Source SDK 2013 SinglePlayer Episodic, but it should be compatible for NonEpisodic and Multiplayer codes.

Credit me (Maestro FÃ©nix) and SysOp if you are going to use it on your mod. This is for everyone.
